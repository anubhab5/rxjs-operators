`combineLatest` is an operator in RxJS that merges the values emitted by multiple observables into a single observable.
 
 It subscribes to each observable in order and collects an array of the most recent values from each observable.
 
 The resulting observable emits an array of values, where the order corresponds to the order of the passed observables.
 
 The static version of `combineLatest` accepts an array of observables, making it useful when the number of observables to combine 
 is not known in advance. An empty array will result in an observable that completes immediately.
 
 To ensure that the output array always has the same length, `combineLatest` waits for all input observables to emit at least once 
 before emitting results. If some observables emit values before others start emitting, those initial values may be lost. 
 
 If an observable completes without emitting any values, the resulting observable will complete without emitting anything. 
 
 If any observable errors, `combineLatest` will error immediately and unsubscribe from all other observables.
 
 The resulting observable from `combineLatest` completes when all combined streams complete. 
 
 Even if one observable completes, the resulting observable will still emit values when others emit. 
 
 If an observable completes, its value will always be the last emitted value.'
